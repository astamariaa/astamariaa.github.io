    <h1>Shifting Shadows: How Crime in San Francisco Has Changed Over Time</h1>
    <p class="lede">
      A magazine-style data story exploring how crime patterns in San Francisco have evolved over the past decade.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding the Dataset</h2>
    <p>
      This project uses the San Francisco Police Department’s publicly available crime dataset (2010–2020). It includes reports of various incidents, along with timestamps, coordinates, and categories. For clarity, we removed duplicate records and filtered out prostitution-related cases (covered in prior coursework).
    </p>

    <h2>Crime Trends Over Time</h2>
    <p>
      This time-series chart shows how crime volume fluctuated over the decade. A notable dip appears in 2020, likely reflecting COVID-19 lockdown effects.

    <h2>Hotspots of Crime</h2>

      Mapping incident data reveals spatial clusters. The Mission District and parts of downtown SF remain high-density zones for various types of crime.
