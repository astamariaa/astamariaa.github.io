    <h1>Shifting Shadows: How Crime in San Francisco Has Changed Over Time</h1>
    <p class="lede">
      A data-driven look at how crime patterns have evolved in San Francisco over the past decade.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding the Data</h2>
    <p>
      This story explores trends in crime across San Francisco using real data from the city's official SF Crime Dataset. 
      The data covers incidents reported to the SFPD from 2010–2020, including type, location, and time of each crime. 
      We removed duplicates, filtered incomplete records, and excluded prostitution-related incidents, which we examined in prior coursework.
    </p>

    <h2>Crime Trends Over Time</h2>
    <p>
      The figure below shows how reported crimes changed over the years. We see spikes in certain categories, 
      possible effects of policy changes, and gradual shifts in types of reported offenses.

    <h2>Where Crime Happens</h2>
    <p>
      Crime is not evenly distributed. The map below highlights the most affected areas. 
      Downtown and parts of the Mission district show consistently high incident counts.
