## Introduction

Digital platforms are increasingly affecting our daily experiences, and users want the ability to interact with their data. 

In this project, we explore how **personal data interactions** can be enhanced by allowing users to explore their **music listening history** inside a web interface.

Our system provides a more **customizable version of Spotify Wrapped** â€” where the user is not just a passive observer but an active explorer.

## Interactive Visuals ðŸŽ§

We'll showcase:

- Listening trends over time  
- Genre evolution  
- Artist diversity  
- Mood patterns  
- Interactive filters (day, time, skip rate, etc.)
